# Speaker Notes: Why AI Makes You More of an Engineer, Not Less

## Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)

**On Screen:** Title and subtitle

**Speaker Notes:**
Good morning! I'm Oliver, and I'm here to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot lately. We keep hearing about AI making developers "10x faster" or "10x more productive." But I think we're missing the real story. Today I want to share why I believe AI doesn't make you 10x faster - it makes you 10x enabled. And that's a much more powerful transformation.

## Slide 2: The Daughter Story (2 minutes)

**On Screen:** The two quotes about Lego building

**Speaker Notes:**
This all started with a conversation with my daughter. She asked me what I do for work - you know how kids do. I used to tell her that programming is like professional Lego building. You carefully place each piece, following your mental blueprint, building something complex from simple components.

But recently, I had to update that explanation. Now I tell her: "I explain to the computer in German what I want to build, and it builds it like a Lego robot." The transformation has been that dramatic.

**[Audience Engagement]** How many of you have tried to explain your job to your kids recently? *[Show of hands, brief interaction]*

But here's what hit me during that conversation - I was wrong about what makes someone an engineer. It was never about placing the Lego pieces. It was about knowing what to build and why.

## Slide 3: The 10x Myth (2-3 minutes)

**On Screen:** The 10x developer concept

**Speaker Notes:**
Everywhere you look, people are talking about "10x developers." The idea that AI will make us 10 times faster at coding, 10 times more productive, 10 times better at our jobs.

And I get it - it's a compelling narrative. Who wouldn't want to be 10x faster? But here's the thing: I've been working with AI tools for over a year now, and that's not what I've experienced.

Don't get me wrong - AI has transformed how I work. But not in the way everyone's talking about. The real transformation is much more profound than just speed.

**[Pause for effect]**

AI doesn't make you 10x faster. AI makes you 10x enabled. And there's a huge difference.

## Slide 4: The Real Shift (1 minute)

**On Screen:** "Von Unmöglich zu Machbar" concept

**Speaker Notes:**
The real shift - and I love this German phrase - is "Von Unmöglich zu Machbar." From "Impossible" to "Possible."

It's not about doing the same things faster. It's about doing things you never thought you could do at all. Let me show you what I mean with three real examples from my own work.

## Slide 5: Story 1 - The Jumping Train (2 minutes)

**On Screen:** Problem description and solution path

**Speaker Notes:**
At DB Systel, I work with streaming train position data. We have this known problem: in workshops and depots, GPS signals are weak or blocked. This causes trains to "jump" around on the map - one second they're here, the next they're 500 meters away.

Now, trains don't teleport. They move on tracks, with predictable physics. But before AI, solving this would have meant diving into academic papers about signal processing, learning about Kalman filters, understanding state estimation theory. Honestly? I probably would have just lived with the jumping trains.

But with Claude, I could describe the problem: "I have noisy GPS data for objects that move along predictable paths with high continuity." Within a few iterations, I had a working directional Kalman filter implementation.

The key insight: I didn't become 10x faster at reading academic papers. I became enabled to solve a problem I didn't even know how to approach before.

## Slide 6: Story 2 - Canvas Magic (1.5 minutes)

**On Screen:** Canvas drag-and-drop concept

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's another example. For a personal project, I needed pixel-perfect QR code placement on images. The solution was HTML Canvas - something I'd never worked with.

Before AI, this would have meant days of tutorials, learning coordinate systems, understanding event handling in 2D contexts. With bolt.new, I had the basic functionality in seconds. With Claude helping with the drag-and-drop mechanics, I had a working solution in minutes.

Again - not 10x faster at learning Canvas. But enabled to focus on my actual problem instead of getting lost in implementation details.

## Slide 7: Story 3 - The MCP Server (1.5 minutes)

**On Screen:** MCP server development

**Speaker Notes:**
One more example. I wanted to build a development workflow assistant - something that would guide me through structured development phases and maintain context about what I'm building.

This required understanding the Model Context Protocol, TypeScript SDK details, server architecture. Complex stuff. But with GitMCP providing documentation to Claude, it practically implemented itself.

The pattern is clear: AI doesn't make me a faster TypeScript developer. It enables me to build tools I never thought I could create.

## Slide 8: What This Actually Means (2 minutes)

**On Screen:** Skills that matter

**Speaker Notes:**
So what does this actually mean for us as engineers? 

It means the game has changed, but not in the way most people think. It's not about speed - it's about expanding what's possible.

The skills that matter now are the same skills that always mattered in engineering:
- Understanding what problem you're trying to solve
- Designing creative solutions
- Knowing what you want to achieve

What's new is Context Engineering - the ability to effectively communicate with AI systems. But even that is just a new form of the communication skills engineers have always needed.

The boundary between "too complex for me" and "I can do this" has shifted dramatically. And that's where the real power lies.

## Slide 9: The New Engineering Reality (2 minutes)

**On Screen:** Traditional vs. partnership approach

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's what I want you to remember: Traditional engineering has always been about understanding problems and finding solutions. That fundamental hasn't changed.

What's new is the partnership model. Think about it this way:

You bring the engineering mindset - the ability to break down complex problems, understand systems, and design solutions. You bring workflow skills - knowing how to structure development, manage complexity, and iterate effectively. Most importantly, you bring context - understanding the real problem, the constraints, the users, the business needs.

AI brings implementation capability - it can write code, configure systems, process data. It brings broad domain knowledge - from Kalman filters to Canvas APIs to TypeScript SDKs. And it brings rapid iteration - the ability to try multiple approaches quickly.

Neither of you is complete alone. But together? Problems that seemed impossible become achievable.

This isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about developers and AI forming a new kind of engineering partnership. And the developers who understand this partnership - who know how to leverage their unique human skills while effectively collaborating with AI - they're the ones who will thrive.

The key insight: You're not competing with AI. You're teaming up with it. And that team is incredibly powerful.

## Slide 10: The Invitation (2 minutes)

**On Screen:** Supportive closing message

**Speaker Notes:**
So here's my invitation to you: AI doesn't replace engineers - it gives us superpowers we never knew we needed.

If you're feeling uncertain about this change, that's completely normal. Every engineer I know has felt that way, including me. Change is uncomfortable, especially when it feels this fundamental.

But here's the beautiful thing: you already have the most important skill. You know how to solve problems. You understand systems. You think in terms of inputs, outputs, and transformations.

Those skills aren't going anywhere. In fact, they're more valuable than ever.

Everything else - the new tools, the new ways of working, the new possibilities - we can learn together. The engineering community has always been about continuous learning and helping each other grow.

This is just our next adventure.

## Slide 11: Thank You (30 seconds)

**On Screen:** Thank you and questions

**Speaker Notes:**
Thank you. I'd love to hear your questions and your own experiences with AI tools. What problems have you been able to tackle that seemed impossible before? What are you excited to explore next?

Let's talk about what becomes possible when we're 10x enabled.
