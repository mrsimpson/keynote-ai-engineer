# Development Plan: not-impossible-keynote

*Generated on 2025-07-10 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: slides*

## Goal
Create a 10-15 minute keynote presentation titled "Why AI Makes You More of an Engineer, Not Less" for developers. Focus on the "10x enabled" concept rather than "10x faster", using personal examples to show how AI shifts problems from "impossible" to "possible".

## Key Decisions
- **Title**: "Why AI Makes You More of an Engineer, Not Less"
- **Opening**: Enhanced daughter story with "I was wrong" realization
- **Core Myth to Bust**: "10x faster developer" → Reality is "10x enabled developer" (if skills match)
- **Main Theme**: Skills matching and enablement, not speed
- **Tone**: Self-reflective, honest, and supportive (not fear-based)
- **Focus Shift**: Less about code typing, more about capability amplification
- **Key Examples**: Three stories from blog post - jumping trains (Kalman filter), Canvas drag-and-drop, MCP server
- **Central Concept**: "Von Unmöglich zu Machbar" (From Impossible to Possible)
- **Closing Approach**: "The Invitation" - supportive, normalizes uncertainty, emphasizes existing problem-solving skills
- **Partnership Angle**: Emphasize collaboration between developer (context, workflow, engineering mindset) and AI (implementation, domain knowledge, iteration)
